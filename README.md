# Web-Design_Challenge

This assignment presents a dashboard website (https://nathanjpotter.github.io/Web-Design_Challenge/) of weather data visualizations which were created in a past assignment ('WeatherPy').

The website contains a landing page, four visualization pages, a comparisons page and a data page, all with explanations of the visualizations. Each page provides a means of navigating to other pages on the website. To navigate to the homepage, click on 'LATITUDE' in the navbar.

Bootstrap was used in developing the website, along with CSS files for some of the styling.

The 'Images' folder contains the pre-existing images (provided along with the homework instructions) of what the website was supposed to look like.

The 'Resources' folder contains the CSS files, jupyter notes files (csv_to_html) and the 'cities_html' file, which was created from the cities.csv files provided. The 'assets' folder within the 'Resources' folder contains the png files used for the visualizations. 

The 'Visualizations' folder contains html files of the four visulization pages as well as the comparison page and data page.
