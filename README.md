# Web-Design_Challenge

This assignment presents a dashboard website (https://nathanjpotter.github.io/Web-Design_Challenge/) of weather data visualizations which were created in a past assignment ('WeatherPy').

The website contains a landing page, four visualization pages, a comparisons page and a data page, all with explanations of the visualizations. Each page provides a means of navigating to other pages on the website.
